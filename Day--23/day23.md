# Adversarial Attacks on Large Language Models (LLMs)

## Introduction:
Understanding and mitigating adversarial attacks on Large Language Models (LLMs) is crucial for ensuring their robustness and reliability in real-world applications. 
## Key Points:

### 1. Adversarial Attacks:
- **Description:** Adversarial attacks involve crafting input samples with imperceptible perturbations to deceive LLMs into producing incorrect outputs or making erroneous predictions.
- **Objective:** The objective of adversarial attacks is to exploit vulnerabilities in LLMs' decision boundaries and manipulate their behavior.

### 2. Types of Adversarial Attacks:
- **Text Perturbations:** Injecting subtle changes into input text to alter LLMs' predictions or generate unintended outputs.
- **Model Poisoning:** Manipulating LLMs' training data or fine-tuning process to induce biased or malicious behavior.
- **Evasion Attacks:** Crafting adversarial examples to evade detection or classification by LLM-based systems, such as spam filters or content moderation algorithms.

### 3. Mitigation Strategies:
- **Adversarial Training:** Augmenting LLM training data with adversarial examples and incorporating robust optimization techniques to enhance resilience against attacks.
- **Input Preprocessing:** Applying input preprocessing techniques, such as input sanitization or noise injection, to mitigate the impact of adversarial perturbations.
- **Adversarial Detection:** Developing mechanisms to detect and flag adversarial inputs during inference, enabling LLMs to reject or handle them appropriately.
