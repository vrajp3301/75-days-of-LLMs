# LLMs on Text Summarization

## Introduction:
Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in text summarization, condensing lengthy documents or articles into concise and informative summaries. This README delves into the utilization of LLMs for text summarization tasks, along with references for deeper understanding.

## Key Points:

### 1. Role of LLMs in Text Summarization:
- **Description:** LLMs employ advanced natural language processing techniques to understand the context and extract key information from input documents, enabling accurate and coherent summarization.
- **Transformer Architecture:** LLMs, such as GPT and BERT, leverage transformer architectures that excel in capturing long-range dependencies and contextual information essential for summarization tasks.

### 2. Applications:
- **Document Summarization:** LLMs can generate summaries for long documents, helping users quickly grasp the main points and essential information.
- **News Summarization:** LLMs are utilized to generate concise summaries of news articles, enabling users to stay updated with relevant information in a shorter time.

### 3. Performance Evaluation:
- **ROUGE Score:** The ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation) score is commonly used to evaluate the quality of text summarization by comparing generated summaries to human reference summaries.
- **Human Evaluation:** Human assessment through readability, coherence, and informativeness judgments provides valuable insights into the quality and usability of LLM-generated summaries.
