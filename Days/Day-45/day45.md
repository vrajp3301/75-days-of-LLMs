# LLMs for Automated Essay Scoring

## Introduction:
Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly employed for automated essay scoring tasks, leveraging their language understanding capabilities to assess and evaluate written compositions.

## Key Points:

### 1. Automated Essay Scoring:
- **Task Definition:** Automated essay scoring involves evaluating written essays based on predefined criteria such as content, organization, language use, and coherence.
- **Objective Assessment:** LLMs provide objective and consistent scoring of essays, reducing the subjectivity and bias associated with human grading.

### 2. Techniques and Approaches:
- **Feature Extraction:** LLMs extract linguistic features from essays, including vocabulary richness, syntactic complexity, coherence, and thematic development.
- **Scoring Models:** Supervised learning models, such as regression or classification algorithms, are trained on annotated essay datasets to predict essay scores based on extracted features.

### 3. Applications and Challenges:
- **Educational Assessment:** Automated essay scoring aids educators in efficiently grading and providing feedback on large volumes of student essays, supporting personalized learning and instruction.
- **Scoring Consistency:** Ensuring the reliability and consistency of automated essay scoring models requires rigorous evaluation and validation against human annotations.
