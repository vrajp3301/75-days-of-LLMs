# Exploring OpenAI's GPT Series

## Introduction:
OpenAI's GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) series represents a significant milestone in natural language processing (NLP) research. This README provides an overview of the GPT series, its evolution, key features, and applications.

## Key Aspects of GPT Series:
- **Evolution:** The GPT series has evolved from GPT to GPT-2 and GPT-3, each iteration pushing the boundaries of what's possible in NLP.
- **Architecture:** Built upon the transformer architecture, GPT models leverage self-attention mechanisms to capture context and generate human-like text.
- **Training:** The GPT models are pre-trained on vast amounts of text data using unsupervised learning techniques, enabling them to understand and generate coherent text across a wide range of topics.
- **Applications:** GPT models have been used for various applications, including text generation, language translation, question answering, and dialogue systems.
