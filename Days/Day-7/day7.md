# Generative vs. Discriminative Models in AI

## Introduction:
Generative and discriminative models are two fundamental approaches in artificial intelligence (AI) for modeling data and making predictions. This README provides an overview of generative and discriminative models, their differences, and their applications in AI.

## Generative Models:
Generative models aim to learn the joint probability distribution of the input features and labels. By modeling the entire distribution, generative models can generate new samples similar to those in the training data. Examples of generative models include Gaussian mixture models (GMM), autoencoders, and generative adversarial networks (GANs).

## Discriminative Models:
Discriminative models focus on learning the conditional probability distribution of the labels given the input features. Instead of modeling the entire distribution, discriminative models directly learn to classify or predict the labels based on the input data. Examples of discriminative models include logistic regression, support vector machines (SVM), and deep neural networks (DNNs).

## Differences:
- **Objective:** Generative models aim to model the joint probability distribution, while discriminative models focus on modeling the conditional probability distribution.
- **Output:** Generative models can generate new samples from the learned distribution, whereas discriminative models directly output predictions or classifications.
- **Complexity:** Generative models tend to be more complex than discriminative models since they need to model the entire distribution.
- **Applications:** Generative models are useful for tasks such as data generation, image synthesis, and anomaly detection, while discriminative models excel in classification, regression, and pattern recognition tasks.

## Applications:
- **Generative Models:** Image generation, text generation, data augmentation.
- **Discriminative Models:** Classification, regression, object detection.
